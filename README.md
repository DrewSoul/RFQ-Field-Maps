# RFQ-Field-Maps
# The four files here all serve to create a file of a simulated electric field. The field file can then be used in conjunction with other software to simulate an RFQ linear accelerator. It can be seen from the filenames that each uses different methods to calculate two important parameters of an RFQ, "a" and "m". Two allow for a function, with respect to distance along the accelerator, the be input to define "a" and "m", while the other two assume a linear increase in these parameters based on a desired initial and final velocity/energy. One of each of these assumes that particles travelling through the accelerator have linearly increasing energy, while the other two assume linearly increasing velocity.
